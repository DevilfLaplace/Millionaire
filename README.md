# Millionaire
A tiny quiz app //C# project 1

First of all I made a "Who wants to be a millionaire" but actually you earn 5000Â£ even if you solve all questions.
But of course you can change it.

In main class I split my codes to 5 parts:

1- Variables       = This part is where I defined the vaiables like user false-true-empty-money count and besides user name, surname and its answer
2- First Screen    = In this part I changed the subject and window size; And take name and surname from user.                                                                      
3- Questin Bank    = This is list that I add questions in. I defined 10 questions.                                                                                                 
4- Question Screen = It is the screen that show you writen questions. In the loop 'z' is questions count. And 'i' is how much questions will shown.


In QuestionBank class I defined 6 public variables and generate a method for them. I override them in a nice shape.
